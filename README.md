**Week 02**: Machine Learning Fundamentals [![Open in PDF](https://img.shields.io/badge/-PDF-EC1C24?style=flat-square&logo=adobeacrobatreader)](https://github.com/ivanovitchm/ppgeec2318/blob/main/lessons/week02/fundamentals.pdf)
- Motivation: how advances in Machine Learning are helping bridge the gap between AI's current capabilities and human cognitive abilities, highlighting limitations and future directions for AI systems.
- Overview of Machine Learning fundamentals, including an exploration of semi-supervised learning, active learning, and weak supervision.
- Discussion on Moravec's Paradox: examining the difference in cognitive complexity between tasks easily handled by AI versus tasks natural to humans.
- Self-supervised learning: Introduction to pretext tasks, where models are trained on unlabeled data, and their application in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Key Concepts:
- Semi-supervised Learning: Training a model using both labeled and unlabeled data.
- Active Learning: A model that actively seeks human-labeled data for improved accuracy.
- Weak Supervision: Using weakly labeled data generated through heuristics or external knowledge sources.
- Self-Supervised Learning: Training models on pretext tasks to build representations from unlabeled data, with applications in NLP.
